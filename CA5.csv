* Reduction of pain points
* Accessiblity considerations
* Compatability
* Availability
* Good user experience
* Cultural awareness and diversity"
"# Explain:

How appropriate and effective functionality can be used to meet user needs and ensure quality of products/services","* Can improve how employees carry out tasks (eg: internal and external comms)
* Can speed up technical existing processes or provide new and more flexible ways of working
* Assessment should be made of what is needed to meet requirements of organisation and consider inefficiencies - should what competitors use too"
"# Explain:

Low budgets as a pain point

| How digital is used to meet user needs and ensure quality of product/ser","* When organisations are under pressure they may be underfunded to not be able to implement technology
* Costs can increase quickly and organisations often try to cut costs in an attempt to save money"
"# Explain:

Communication as a pain point

| How digital is used to meet user needs and ensure quality of product/ser","* Lack of communication or miscommunication between the IT dep. and oither dep. can be a barrier to adapting to and entering digital tech era
* Different dep. have different strategies to grow the business and increase its success - therefore important that all dep. communicate effectively with each other to share visions and collaborate"
"# Explain:

Lack of technical knowledge by end users as a pain point

"# Explain:

How cultural awareness and diversity can be used to meet user needs and ensure quality of products/services","* Reception and use of technology in the workplace can be influenced by several factors including socioeconimical status - this should be considered when developing technology
* Availability of digital technology varies according to an individual's socioeconmical status (digital divide)
* Due to the digital divide some people may be less familiar and reluctant or unable to use them
* This means new technologies may have to be implemented or accompanied by training"
