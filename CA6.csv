"# Explain:

Structure

| Data Wrangling",Most data is unstructured and disorganised so it must be give na structure to make sure it is accessible and this structure will depend on the requirements of the output for analysis.
"# Explain:

Cleansing

| Data Wrangling",Remove any anomalies from the data and make sure that it does not skew the final analysis if the requirements are not fully met. Cleansing will also remvoe any formatting anomalies from varied collection methods.
"# Explain:

Enrichment

| Data Wrangling","If data that has been collected not fully meet the requirements, then one solution is data enrichment (or combining data sets). Enrichment of data involves adding or combining data sets so that the results of processing and analysis meet requirements fully. Data enrichment can be beneficial by saving a company by reducing the amount of primary data needing to be collected."
