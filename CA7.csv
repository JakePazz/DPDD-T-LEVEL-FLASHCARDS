* The hub manages and controls all network functions"
"# State:

2 advantages of a star network topology","2 of:
* Easy to install, wire and reconfigure

* Network is dependent on the backbone cable - if this fails, the whole network fails
* The bigger the network, the more complicated it becomes to configure
* Limit to the length of each segment within the network that is also dependant on the type of cabling used

"# State:

2 examples of types of virtualisation and briefly explain them","2 of:
* Data virtualisation - Treat data as a dynamic supply, provide processing functions that can bring data together from multiple sources and tranform data and accommodate new data sources
* Desktop virtualisation - Install multiple OSs onto a single machine, to allow a central admin to install simulated destop environments on very large quantities of physical machines simultaneously - allowing mass configuration, updates etc.
* Server vritualisation - Allow a server to serve multiple functions at once (involves partitioning)
* OS virtualisation - Load multiple types of operating system side by side, making multiple accessible on one device reducing hardware costs and increases security as all virtual instances can be monitored
* Network function virtualisation - Seperate key network functions independent of hardware, allowing them to be packaged together to form a new network, reducing number of physical components required to create multiple independent networks"
"# State:

5 key features of virtual environments","4 of:
* Increased security - Manager can control and filter activity of guest's programs; mitigate risk of harmful operations being carried out
* Managed execution - Execution of sharing, aggregation, emulation and isolation managed from central virtual server
* Sharing - Creation of separate computing environments within same host reduces number of active servers and limits power consumption
* Aggregation - Group of hosts are combined and presented to guests as a single virtual host - done with cluster management software
* Emulation - Guest programs are executed in an environment that is controlled by a virtualisation layer, which allows for completely different environments to the host to be smulated meaning execution of guest programs that require specific characteristics
* Isolation - Each guest has a separate environment and the VM can filter activities of the guests and mitigate the risk of harmful operations against the host - also allows performance tuning
* Portability - hardware virtualisation = Virtual image of guest can safely be moved and programming-level virtualisation = binary code representing application components can run on any installation of the corresponding VM"

Another advantage of data .......................... is that it provides a mechanism for improving the ...................... of the data because it can be ........................ across multiple sites","Redundancy, Compared"
"# Explain:

Briefly, 2 disadvantages of data redundancy","* Data redundancy can cause data inconsistency if it is stored in multiple locations but the data does not match
* Risk of data corruption due to the transfer and/or storage of data between locations/systems
* Additional costs required for the storage of the data"
"# Explain:

Hardware redundancy",Consists of one or more additional compelte hardware systems (eg: additonal servers that can be used in case of failure)
"# Explain:

Briefly, 3 types of redundancy","* Dynamic - Where only one system is working at a time and in case of faioure an additional system is started so that the business processes can continue with minimum disruption
* Static - Where systems run in parallel, all carrying out the same processes - results are continually compared to check accuracy where in case of mismatches a predefined algorithm decides the best outcome
* Hybrid - Combination of dynamic and static hardware redundancy

These can be applied to both hardware and software redundancy"
"# Explain:

Disadvantages of hardware redundancy","* Means a more complicated system
* Additional costs for the components involved
* Redundant systems also have to be updated, upgraded and maintained alongside the main systems (otherwise it will become unreliable and less resilient)"
"# Explain:

Software redundancy",Where there is additional software that can carry out the same tasks as the current software being used
"# Explain:

Back-up systems","* Not just backing up data but whole system (OS, software, configs)
* If incident occurs, business can restore system to a position prior to the incident"
"# State:

3 types of disaster recovery sites","* Hot site
* Cold site
* Warm site"
"# Explain:

Hot site","* Usually in a different location and runs in parallel to the normal system
* Replicate primary system and are usually maintained by third party (at a cost)
* Because they run in parallel they allow prompt restoration of functionality incase of an incident
* Because these sites have a backup of data, they allow immediate access to up-to-date data without having to source the location of any other data backups
* Can be in the cloud
* 'A fully functioning, up-to-date replica in respect to equipment and data'"
"# Explain:

Cold site","* Cheapest option as it does not involve all facilities needed for hot site
* Only usually used when critical disaster occurs
* Only a form of data center so incase of an incident technical expertise will be required to install and configure the computer equipment so that the business can continue to function
* 'Only have data and none of the equipment for the business environment'"
"# Explain:

Warm site","* Combination of a hot and cold site
* Digital equipment is made readily available but data must be restored onto the system
* Cost wise is between hot and cold sites
* 'Contains basic equipment used in the business environment but does not include any data'"
"# State:

4 types of backups","* Full backup
* Incremental backup
* Differential backup
* Mirror backup"
"# Explain:

Full backup","* Backup of every file and folder in a system
* More time consuming and requires sufficient space for all of the data
* Faster when restoring lost data
* More robust and reliable than alternatives
* Only suitable if there is large changes to data on a regular basis"
"# Explain:

Incremental backup","* After creating full backup, only backup data that has changed since last backup
* Use less storage than full backups but use additional resources/compute to compare states of backups/data
* More time consuming to restore data from an incremental backup than full backup because it has to analyse the data within the backup to establish the timestamp for when data changed - several incremental backups may be required to restore data"
"# Explain:

Differential backup","* Data initially does full backup
* Then will only backup the data that has changed since **last full** backup
* Easier to recover data as only requires full backup and most recent differential backup"
"# Explain:

Mirror backup","* It is only a backup of the data, but entire system (OS, applications, configs)
* If hard drive fails, new HDD can be installed and mirror backup taken from the failed drive and can be restored onto new hard drive
* Faster than other backup types and create a 'clean' copy without old or outdated files and folders"
"# State:

4 ways that device hardening can be done","4 of;
* Disabling unused network ports
* Strict password management and file permissions
* Using multi-factor authentication using hardware tokens as well as passwords on networks
* Updating computer systems with security patches as they become available 
* Removing all non-essential services and programs
* Setting time limits on access - can be frustrating for the user to be locked out after a short period of time because they have eg: answered a phone call"
