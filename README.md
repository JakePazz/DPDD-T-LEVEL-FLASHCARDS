# DPDD T Level: Core Content Flashcards
Flashcards made for use with the core papers for the UK's T Level in Digital Production, Design and Development.

I have provided both the links to the brainscape classes containing decks for each content area subsection (with some combined) as well as the csv files directly to make it easier to download the files for importing into a different platform.

## Links
Each classroom is one content area from 1 to 8, with a deck per subsection (some have been combined because they are small or combined in the book) but if you want to make changes to the content of the flashcards, make a copy of the class on brainscape, and you should be able to do so.

_These have not yet been started and will not be found within the brainscape classes_

## Notes
- Open an issue (or message me) if you find content problems, spelling mistakes or anything else let me know
- All sections that have been covered should include all content that is in the core textbook, but with examples or some smaller details skipped because there is already enough flashcards...
- Unsure how often I will update the csv files and lists above, but if there is clear mismatches between the csvs and brainscape, you should (I think) be able to download the csvs after copying the classes to your own account anyway
